## SYSC 4806 - Group Project

### Group members: Triton Crowley, Jason Zhang, Caleb Lui-yee, Nitin Alagu, Nick Yung

### Current State (as per Kanban):
In the current state, it is a full stack web application using Svelte as the frontend language, and Spring Boot as our server logic. The app allows users to register, login and edit their profile which allows them to add memberships to their profile. All users have the option to upload a perk by filling in the appropriate fields, in which upon uploading a new perk, it will display it as a perk card in the perk manager. Users can click the card to see the perk code associated with it, and can see the upvotes/downvotes associated with the perk. The user can also vote if they desire. A filter section is included with the sort section that allows users to filter through certain cards based off membership, product, or geographic location. Cards can be sorted based off title alphabetically, number of votes, and expiry date. The cards are displayed dynamically and can be delete by the appropriate user.
